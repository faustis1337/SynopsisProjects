This project, when the SQL folder is run, can automatically create the database, we suggest you let it do so.

If you dont want to automatically create the database, there is a file called manually create SQL DB. 
Before you run it, you will need to create a Database named "SqlProject" in your localhost version of SQL SERVER.
This is so that our connector, under the Connection Directory in SQL project can connect to the database.
